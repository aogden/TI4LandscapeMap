In the top left corner of your browser during Async TI4 you will see a button "Switch Orientation" and a slider "Split %"

The button toggles between portrait and landscape layout. The slider adjusts the split point where the map horizontally meets the game overview. Adjust this slider to match your game (the preference is saved so you only need to do it once)
